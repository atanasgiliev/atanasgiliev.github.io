On this page, you can find some of my longer projects. I have separated them
into categories for convenience. The exception is things I have done before
college which are grouped to together in the last category. Feel free to contact
me about any of the projects below :)

### Computer Science

* **[TreeDSL](/readme.html)** (**[GitHub](https://github.com/atanasgiliev/TreeDSL)**, *in progress*)

A domain-specific programming language I'm building along two classmates. The basic premise is
that you write down a tree diagram in an extremely intuitive syntax where the amount of
indentation indicates the current depth level in the tree and then our language visualizes
the tree graph for you. We hope that it finds applications in family trees, taxonomy,
graph theory, consulting, and more. So far we have a functioning ANTLR grammar as well
as a working lexer and parser.

### Quantitative Finance

* **[S&P *N* Indices](/math861.pdf)** (**[GitHub](https://github.com/atanasgiliev/SP-N-Indices)**)

In this paper, we propose S&P *N* indices that track market cap
weighted portfolios of the largest *N* publicly traded companies on US
exchanges. First, we discuss the specifics about the construction of
each portfolio. Then we calculate a historical Sharpe ratio for each
index over a month for 6 months. Last, we produce a forward looking
1 month Sharpe ratio for each S&P *N* index and compare the results
to the historical ones. We perform a Spearman correlation coefficient
testing to compare the two methods of calculation.

* **[Futures Based Interest Rate Model](/math961.pdf)** (**[GitHub](https://github.com/atanasgiliev/Futures-Based-Interest-Rate-Model)**)

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an alternative way to calibrate one-factor
interest rate models. Instead of using the interest rate yield curve, we
suggest that they are anchored to the interest rate futures curve. We
implement the Ho-Lee model due to its simplicity and tractability. We
fitted this model to the 3 month SOFR futures curve and used it to
predict zero-coupon bond prices. Finally, we suggest future steps to
expand on a more sophisticated volatility function and using r
∗ (neutral interest rate) as the mean reverting term in the drift function.

### Theology

* ***On Universalism*** (*coming soon*)

An incoming article I'm currently writing for the 2024 Fall issue of the Dartmouth
Apologia. It gives a defense of Trinitarian Universalism arguing that universal single
predestination should be the default position based on the intuitive case and that no
argument is sufficiently strong to rise to the burden of proof required to overthrow it.

### Older

* ***[Construction and Analysis of Greedy Sequences of Non-Negative Integers](/greedy.pdf)*** (**[Beamer](/pres.pdf)**)

Abstract: A “greedy” sequence is a number sequence of non-negative integer in
which the first member is 0 every next member is defined as the smallest
integer larger than the last term such that a certain equation is avoided for
two or more terms. We start by analyzing the Stanley Sequence (avoiding
arithmetic progression) beginning with 0, 1, and construct a non-recursive
formula for calculating its terms. We then define some notation and move
on to analyzing different greedy sequences. We use different numerical
systems to do so and try to conjecture what can be achieved by this
approach.  

I won a few national competitions with this project and presented it at
Expo Sciences Luxembourg. I also won a silver medal at the 2021 ICYS.

* ***[Numbers as Properties in Logicism](/numbers.pdf)***

Abstract: Since Russell’s paradox was pointed to Frege, the logicism movement
with the exception of the neo-logicists has been largely abandoned. In this
paper, Frege’s semantic system is revisited and his arguments are refuted
to show that numbers are not objects but concepts, and more specifically--
 properties. It is shown there are needed to distinguish between entities
and a logical definition of such distinctions is given. Singular terms and
predicates are also revised to show that the new system can benefit from
Hume’s principle and can enjoy the results from Frege’s theorem.

I worked on this with Dr Owen Griffiths (Churchill College, Cambridge) on a
scholarship from the Cambridge Center for International Research back in my last
high school Summer.

* ***[Vector Spaces from Logic](/math69.pdf)***

Abstract: We give a language and a set Σ of sentences of that language such
that any structure A that is a model of Σ is a vector space over Q.
We then give sets Γn for each n such that the vector space given by
A is of dimension n or more exactly when A satisfies Γn with some
variable assignment. Then we show that Cn(Σ) is incomplete and
discuss what extensions make it complete. Throughout the paper we
consider how our conclusions would differ if the vector spaces we were
considering were over a finite field F instead of Q. Finally, we discuss
the implications of these results for determining the dimension of a
vector space given by such a structure A.

* **[Comments on *The Foundations of Arithmetic*](/comments.pdf)**

A short commentary on Frege's arguments from the *Grundlagen* that
supposedly refute the notion that natural numbers are properties. I critique
these arguments as part of a preparation for the Cambridge project described above.
