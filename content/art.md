This page documents my experience taking the Dartmouth SART 15 (Drawing I) course.
I'm taking the course with basically no prior drawing experience whatsoever, and
I've been enjoying it a lot. You can find all the pieces I've produced for the
course below along with short assignment descriptions and reflections for each
piece.
