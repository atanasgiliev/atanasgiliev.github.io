## Greetings, pleased to meet you!

---

You found my blog! Well, I don't know if it's exactly a blog...  
I plan to use this site to write about what I currently find interesting.
And this changes a lot.  
Like a ton and then some more. You can find my most recent posts on the
**[Blog](/posts/)** archive page.

Long story short, I'm a college student who studies Math, CS, Greek,
dabbles in finance, loves philosophy, is extremely opinionated,
and is currently learning to draw. If you want to learn more, you can check
out my **[About](/about/)** page. If you are interested into what I've been up
to more recently, you can head to the **[Currently](/currently/)** section.

You can also check some of my larger **[Projects](/projects/)**. Same for my
**[Art](/art/)** (I have just started learning how to draw...). Last, I also
write a monthly riddle which you are welcome to solve at the **[Puzzle](/puzzle/)**
page.

Some last remarks:
* This site uses **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)** and the
**[Bear Cub](https://github.com/clente/hugo-bearcub/tree/main)**
 theme (thanks to my friend Iris for showing me these)
that resembles **[BearBlog](https://bearblog.dev)**.
* It is, however, not hosted there.
* I'm not the most consistent person, so I do apologize in case this becomes too
 inactive.
