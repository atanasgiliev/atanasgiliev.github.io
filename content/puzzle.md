**August 2024 Puzzle:**

Three Germans and a Brit meet in a hotel. It's huge. A German owns it. He hands them
 a menu, and they decide to try one of the dishes. One of them has been trying to make it
since before this establishment existed. The English* found it tastes bad because of
the fifth ingredient in his recipe. Then again, he takes so long to explain things
(just ask the Austrian chap when you see him if you don't believe me). They wait as some
other dishes get prepared. The youngest one gets angry and tears the menu. No wonder
if he starves himself to death. What's the name of the second youngest's godfather?

*(The answer to this puzzle is three words.)*
