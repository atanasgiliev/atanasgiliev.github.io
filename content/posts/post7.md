I am back! It was an incredibly trip. Expect a lot of scattered reflections over
the next few days/weeks. And now I'm back in the woods (for about 2 more weeks,
that is).

In short, the UES was incredibly, I can easily believe why anyone would love to
live there. We found some exciting charming cafes along the way. I think my
favorite one was the Sant Ambroeus location at Hanley. I remember seeing the chain
a few months ago in Milan, and I did not get to try it back then, so I was quite
pleasantly surprised when I saw their little sign on 66th Street.

The Cursed Child show at the Lyric Theater was so... unbelievably... awesome. We
snatched our tickets for about $60 bucks a piece through a special offer, but I
would had easily given a hundred and fifty, if I knew how good exactly it would
have turned out to be.

Downton was nice, and midtown was ugly, but let's not talk about that. And oh Lord
the museums. They were incredible too.

Now, however, it is back to the grind, so let's hope to finish the term strong.
I just finished a project proposal and had a reasonably productive first day of
week 9, but I am a bit stressed about 2 back to back quizzes I have tomorrow.
Wish me luck!
