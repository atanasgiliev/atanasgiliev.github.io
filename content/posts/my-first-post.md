Welcome to the blog! This will be a really short piece addressing something I
have always struggled with but which I hope there is still time to master.

I'm one of those people who begin a lot of stuff and never see them through.
It is not necessarily a bad thing because at least it signals that I'm rarely bored
(I abandon stuff when I find something more interesting to occupy my mind with),
but it is still not ideal.

Throughout my conscious life, I have admired hard work and persistence in a way that
 resembled jelaousy but never really as if they were a virtue. In fact, I never
like it when meritocracy is implicitly associated with hard work because I seem
to treat persistence as I would treat being blue eyed-- An amazing thing that one
is born with.

I'm actually still convinced this is unfortunately at least partially true. After all,
we learn things by doing them repeatedly and consistencly and this is what I mean by
hard work and persistence. Hence, if there is not another way to learn things, it follows,
that being persevearing cannot be learned.

Then again we did invent contacts. I, thankfully, have blue eyes and, even more
gratefully, have good vision as of now. And yet it does give hope that I can become
more consistent...

At the end of the day, I hope I don't abandon this project. There are a few things
I will be incorporating to help me stay on track. No expectations. No goals.
Lots of self praise and rewards.

Today is the 3rd of August. I originally wanted to publish this website (and this post)
on the first, but life got in the way. I will be trying to post one post a day
for the remainder of the month though. Anyway, thanks for reading :)

By the way, please excuse the fact that the **[Projects](/projects/)** and
**[Art](/art/)** pages are unfinished as of yet. I still have to start the former
and add reflections and descriptions to the latter. In the meantime, please check the
August **[Puzzle](/puzzle/)**!
