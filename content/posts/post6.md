Okay, I know I said the second part of the Handel article is coming out today,
but this is going to have to wait. Also, there won't be any posts in the next 3 days,
but I am gonna try and catch up after that. In fact, this is going to be a very short
entry.

I am going to New York! Me and a friend from Oxford decided to do a short 3 day
trip to check the city before the last 2 weeks of 24X Spring terms are called S,
so Summer ones are X). We are both so excited. I am also meeting another friend
whom I met a few years ago in Cambridge, but who is actually from Manhattan and now
studies at King's College London. (And we are all math people.) We are also going
to see a Broadway show at the Lyric Theater. The Harry Potter play!

Anyway, back to busyness. My bus leaves in about 7.5 hours. I
just finished packing. By the way, a 30 bucks steamer was one of the smartest
investments I ever made this term. It does spill a little and I probably should
have went with the slightly more expensive 50 bucks model because my current one
needs refilling about every five minutes, but, honestly, I am so happy with it.
Especially given that my Summer wardrobe is 90% linen trousers and linen shirts.
So now a quick shower followed by a quick shave (I know not ideal and it is kinda
late already, but we do what we have to), a quick night skincare session and,
hopefully, getting as much zzz as possible.

I am excited! Thank you for reading this and I will see you in a few days. (I am going
to take so many pictures and post the most banal Instagram post lol. Also I have
2 quizzes, a project, and 2 labs due next Tuesday.) Peace :D
