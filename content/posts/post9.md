Oh darling weeks 9 and 10 are insane. Even in the Summer. Let me just summarize
some of the things I had to do recently. Essentially between Sunday evening and tomorrow,
I have been (will be) occupied with a 10 page math project, my final milestone
for my POPL CS course, my final assignment for that same course, an astronomy quiz,
the final astronomy lab, the last astronomy worksheet, chapter 7 of Book 1 from
the Aristotle work I have been getting through with my amazing Greek professor, and
whatever else I'm forgetting right now. I also have an interview in a 2 days for
a banking internship in the Fall. And I have an exam and another final project plus
my final drawing piece all due next Monday haha.

I was, however, finally able to finish Thorton's *Our Town* after bascially a month
(it is about 70 pages lol) and I feel great about that though I think it impressed
me a bit more when I read it for the first time 5 years ago. In other reading news,
I have been making progress with Zadie Smith's *On Beauty*. I've done either 41 or 43 (not sure)
percent now and am loving it. I have been trying to read this thing for a couple
of years now and I have been picking it up for the beginning at least a few times
now without much success. I don't want to jinx it, but I think this is the one. It is also
the first time in a long time that I have been reading daily for an extended period of time
instead of just finishing a book in a day or two.

Anyway, tomorrow is going to be quite busy but hopefully after that I will get
a day or two to recover before the final final stretch. And then its back home for a few days
and on to the Queen Victoria for a week long South Europe tour. Can't wait.

Obviously the blog article every day of August challenge is a complete failiure. But then
again an entry on some August days is better than no entries at all I guess. Thank you for reading :)
