I hope this does not become too much of a trend but tonight I'm writing
about applying for internships. It is an interesting thingy. Kinda scary,
incredibly boring, at least somewhat important. Write now I'm looking for
a Fall internship. Why am I doing that? So that I can find a Summer internship that as good as they get.

...

I know... It gets even worse. I'm not really sure what I want to do in
the summer. The more financial statements I read, the more I feel like
I don't care about them. So ideally a quant job. I'm also doing it largely
for the money. But I can also see how a quant job can keep me interested
at least for a few months. And it pays quite well. But these are also
the hardest ones to get. And I'm constantly afraid of not having enough
time to prepare. I'm also lazy. Lazy and paranoid. Not a good combo.
I'm also insightful enough to know that the former is caused by the latter. See the vicious cycle already? And every day I delay my preparation, I have even less time than the day before. I'm almost surely not going to do SE though. If nothing else the office culture seems to hip and they use too much corporate lingo. I can tolerate one of those but not
both at the same time.

Good news, I applied for a Fall internship yesterday and am applying for
an even better one tomorrow. Both of them are IB ones. I was originally
going to finish the second one tonight but I did a Prolog assignment in
the morning for my POPL course, a 3 hour astronomy lab in the evening and
my teammates for our DSL project did not pull as much weight as I wanted them too. But now all this is done. I even did my Duolingo. Still one more long lab to do this week. Thankfully, the fourth and last. Next week is mostly projects and exams. The end is near!

Anyway I'm happy I started. And that's something. If nothing else works, I might as well do an MA in Classics and call it a day :D. Thank you for reading! (These are going to become even more chaotic.)
