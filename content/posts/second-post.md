Like so many people around me, I'm trying to get back into reading. I mean I do
read a lot but not a lot of fiction. And when I do read fiction it is often
either rereading it or reading it form some sort of class.

These are not necessarily bad things. I mean reading is reading and rereading is
better than not reading at all. I am also not one of those people who treat
reading like some essential virtuous habit that separates the cultured from the
rest (and I am a massive highbrow enjoyer). That being said, I used to love
reading just for fun and I would like to get back into the habit.

To that end, here are a few things that I will and will not be doing to try and
read a bit more:

1) **No daily goals. No words, no pages, no anything.**

Some days I just won't read.
This is meant to be fun and I'm trying to change so many habits right now that
I am simply not treating this as another consistency issue.

2) **Shorter genres for the win.**

I have always loved short stories and watching plays. Now, I'm trying reading plays.
I'm currently in the middle of *Our Town* (technically I read it in 9th grade
  but I don't remember a thing). Yes, that's how bad it is. It is a 70 page pdf
I found online and I have been unable to finish it for weeks now. I have my eyes
on *Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead* after I finish that, and I do love Stoppard
so there is a lot to explore.

3) **Novels are in too. But what kind?**

This kind of goes against the last point, but stereotypical as it may be I somehow
need to read a novel to really feel like I'm reading. The good news are I'm going
on a cruise in about a month and I should have enough time for longer works. I have
tried reading Zadie Smith's *On Beauty* twice now and can sense that the third time
is the charm. That being said I find it hard to balance reading classics and
contemporary fiction and I kinda associate the former with Winter for some reason,
so I am not sure if I should find a Summer appropriate classical work break free
from that preconception. Any recs?

4) **TBR**

I do love lists and putting stuff into boxes and categorizing them and ranking them.
I also do lose so much time doing these haha. Given that I am reading for fun, however,
I think I can allow myself to make a reading list that I know I will probably not
finish anytime soon. I will also most likely read a lot of other stuff before I finish
everything on it. So think of it more as an inspiration than a plan. Here you go:

---

* *On Beauty* by Zadie Smith
* *Hamnet* by Maggie O’Farrell
* *The Book of Goose* by Yiyun Li
* *Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell* by Susanna Clarke
* *The Death of Ivan Ilyich* by Leo Tolstoy (Tolstoy gives me the most wintery vibes so probably not for a few months)
* *War and Peace* by Leo Tolstoy
* *A Midsummer Night’s Dream* by William Shakespeare (I don't like most of his comedies unlike the tragedies)
* *Anathem* by Neal Stephenson
* *Shady Hollow* by Juneau Black
* *Stoner* by John Williams
* *Our Town* by Thornton Wilder (currently reading)
* *Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead* by Tom Stoppard

Anyway, that's that. Thank you for reading :)
