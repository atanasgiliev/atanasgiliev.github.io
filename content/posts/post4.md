I was preparing a long article about my favorite composer today. This is not it.
(Don't worry, it is still coming tomorrow.) Instead, when I was halfway done with it,
I stopped, went for a short run, and somehow, without actually realizing it,
convinced myself I'm finishing this long article I have been writing for a student
research journal for weeks now.

This is a win. Lowercase w. At least I hope it is. I'm terrible at finishing stuff.
The worst part is I was never good and I have actually gotten worse at it. I am
one of those kinda Gatsby-like people who are amazing at giving the impression that
they are doing splendidly when they aren't.

Anyway, I finally finished the first draft. It is awful and about twice over the
somewhat not enforced word limit. If I am to be perfectly honest I actually take pride
when I go over the limit. Something reptilian I guess. My style is long and
confusing and not too good, but I have grown to kinda like it haha. It is about 6200 words.
I remember how proud I was when I finished a 10000 words paper in high school.
Thus, I am a bit disappointed I did not crack 5 digits, but if it turns out this word
limit is enforced, perhaps this is for the better.

It will need many revisions but at least it won't need them tomorrow. There is this quote
by Margaret Thatcher. Something about how you feel better at the end of the day if you have
had a lot of work and you managed to do it all than if you just rested the whole day. Gives some
toxic productivity vibes but it is not completely true. Though it is still way less
preferable to vindication or achieving a real goal you have had for a long time. I am not
a fan of working. Never considered it a good thing. Though I don't think it is one of
the worst things either.

There is one more, shorter thing I need to do tonight. Ok maybe two. But if I do this
much easier one perhaps I will feel good. Today wasn't the best day but it also wasn't
too bad. There is also one important thing I did not do so don't feel too good about myself.
Anyway, thank you for reading this short piece :)
